PRE-CONFIGURATION OF METALLB MANIFEST
--

If you are updating the manifest, you will need to do some pre-configuration to the manifest to enable it to go in smoothly
on Openshift. See https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/clouds/#metallb-on-openshift-ocp for the details, and follow
all directions there.
